Run by running main.py on your local machine.

## Justification
We chose to address the problem of food waste by creating an AI Recipe Finder and Ingredient Logger. This tool enables users to track the ingredients they have in their fridge, freezer, and pantry through a digital inventory list that automatically updates after recipes are made, helping to prevent over-purchasing. Another key feature is a camera integration, which allows users to take pictures of their ingredients to generate possible recipes, encouraging creative and efficient use of existing food items.
This project not only promotes sustainability in meal preparation and ingredient purchasing but also allows our team to leverage our diverse skill sets. Those with an interest in UI/UX design crafted an intuitive prototype in Figma, while others focused on back-end development to build functionality for digital logs. By combining our expertise, we created a user-friendly, impactful, and innovative solution to reduce food waste.

## Requirements
We will judge the project's completion on the completion of two major components. First, a high-fidelity prototype to highlight the UI and UX powerhouses in our team. This will be in the form of a Figma that will simulate the front end of the conceptualized final product. This will include screens that show the user flow for inputting ingredients and recipes, viewing the user's “pantry”, and looking for recipe inspiration from the user's current ingredients.
Second, we will be building a super low-fidelity MVP that will leave the focus on the working backend for this product. The GUI powering this application will only be to simulate the actions for this MVP, but hopefully not be ugly. The backend of the application will let users add ingredients and recipes, view them, and use a recipe, removing the depleted ingredients from the user's pantry. A stretch goal for this backend will be allowing the user to upload a photo of ingredients, and get recipe inspiration. This will probably be powered by a shoddy API call to the openAI API.
