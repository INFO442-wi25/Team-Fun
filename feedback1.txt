What was the most useful feedback that your group received?
    Rather than being completely text based, try and have some visual aspect to create a better user experience.

Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?
Make it GUI based rather than CLI based lol.

Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class, what is one technique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?
I want to approach my software development with the intent of learning new things. I was really inspired that one of the groups was so intent on using WAS to host their 340 project. I thought it was really cool.
