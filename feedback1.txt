What was the most useful feedback that your group received?

The most useful feedback that we received was ensuring that each of our features was fleshed out and connected in an intuitive way. Some of our features had the base design, but needed more detail so that the user could fully understand the functionality of it. 


Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?


Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class, what is one technique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?
