What was the most useful feedback that your group received?
Integrating more guiding interactions throughout the app, maybe a tour once the user logs in?

Thinking about your own role in your group, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?
As the designer I will make sure to include a mini tutorial once the user onboards, and add micro interactions to make the overall experience more fun.

Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class, what is one technique or tool that you learned about and may want to try in the future?
Integrating outside APIs, or hosting it on AWS to enrich functionality, like the AWS web hosting team we would use Google's AI API to integrate one of their prompt libraries.
